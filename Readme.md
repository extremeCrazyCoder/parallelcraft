# Parallelcraft

My try for a parallelized minecraft server

Currently work in progress


# Datapack
In order for this Server to work you need to have a Datapack that contains information about wich blocks / items are available and what their properties are.
This might be extracted from a vanilla jar for the vanilla minecraft experience
